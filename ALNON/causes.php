                        The media, including newspapers, TV, radio and the internet play 
                        an important role in spreading the message of support and hope to those 
                        whose lives have been afflicted by alcoholism.

<h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Al-Anon Family Groups welcomes and appreciates the attention of the media.</h1>
As a fellowship of members who are all friends and families of alcoholics, Al-Anon is a useful source for any media outlet looking to understand and raise awareness of alcoholism.


<h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Interviewing Al-Anon members</h1>
We are usually happy to co-operate with journalists and other media professionals as it helps to raise awareness of the effects of drinking on family members and also the existence of Al-Anon meetings.

Please contact us if you need us to arrange an interview
 with an Al-Anon member. We will ask you to respect our members’ anonymity and Al-Anon’s public relations policy by ensuring that the full name and/or photographs of the member interviewed are not published. First names or a pseudonym may be used.

 <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Press releases and public information</h1>
 In addition to member interviews, we can provide information and insight via our press releases, podcasts, videos, and survey results. For help in locating what you need, please contact us.

 <h1 class="display-6 mb-5">Are you being affected by a friend or family member’s drinking?</h1>
 Have you been drawn to writing about alcoholism due to your own personal experiences? Perhaps you grew up with a drinker in the family or have a friend who’s drinking concerns you.

If you feel you may have been negatively affected by a problem drinker, even if they are no longer around, consider coming along to an Al-Anon meeting.
Al-Anon recognises how the media provide a powerful channel for reaching those people who may not have heard of us. By working together effectively, we can help more people to find comfort and strength.
